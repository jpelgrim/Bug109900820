# Bug109900820
This is a sample project for [Bug 109900820](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/109900820)

Note: You need to know the SSID and the mac address of the network you're trying to connect to in this sample project. You can retrieve those values with e.g. the [Bonjour Browser](https://hobbyistsoftware.com/bonjourbrowser)

# Problem description
In my app I'm trying to connect to a hotspot network and sending some wifi-configuration to a device on that hotspot network. I use the following to connect to the hotspot

    NetworkRequest networkRequest = new NetworkRequest.Builder()
            .addTransportType(NetworkCapabilities.TRANSPORT_WIFI)
            .build();

Then in the callback I fetch the NetworkInfo from the available network using the connectivity manager (initialized earlier):

    ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback networkCallback = new ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback() {
    
    @Override
    public void onAvailable(Network network) {
        NetworkInfo networkInfo = connectivityManager.getNetworkInfo(network);
        (...)

At this point `networkInfo.getExtraInfo()` is returning `null` on Android P Beta, where it is returning the SSID on previous versions of Android. I wonder if this is a bug, or if it is intentional that we can’t get that extra (SSID) info as of Android P. I’ve got the `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` and `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` permissions, so that’s not the issue. And again, it’s returning the extra info (SSID) fine for older Android versions.

# Sample output
In the project I included a log statement which outputs the retrieved networkInfo object in the `onAvailable` method. On Android Marshmallow the extra info is the SSID I wanted to connect to 'NODE-0066':

On Android P Beta the extra info is 'null':
