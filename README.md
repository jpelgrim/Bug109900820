# Bug109900820
This is a sample project for [Bug 109900820](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/109900820)

Note: You need to know the SSID and the mac address of the network you're trying to connect to in this sample project. You can retrieve those values in the advanced network settings or sometimes with e.g. the [Bonjour Browser](https://hobbyistsoftware.com/bonjourbrowser) if your hotspot advertises its settings via mDNS.

# Problem description
In my app I'm trying to connect to a hotspot network and sending some wifi-configuration to a device on that hotspot network. I use the following to connect to the hotspot

    NetworkRequest networkRequest = new NetworkRequest.Builder()
            .addTransportType(NetworkCapabilities.TRANSPORT_WIFI)
            .build();

Then in the callback I fetch the NetworkInfo from the available network using the connectivity manager (initialized earlier):

    ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback networkCallback = new ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback() {
    
    @Override
    public void onAvailable(Network network) {
        NetworkInfo networkInfo = connectivityManager.getNetworkInfo(network);
        (...)

At this point `networkInfo.getExtraInfo()` is returning `null` on Android P Beta, where it is returning the SSID on previous versions of Android. I wonder if this is a bug, or if it is intentional that we can’t get that extra (SSID) info as of Android P. I’ve got the `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` permission, so that’s not the issue. And again, it’s returning the extra info (SSID) fine for older Android versions.

# Steps to reproduce
Enter the SSID and the mac address in the appropriate input fields and press the "Go!" button.

**Note**: There's a work around for the fact that we get a security exception on Android 6.0 Marshmallow when calling `connectivityManager.requestNetwork(...)` 

    java.lang.SecurityException: com.xyz.app was not granted either of these permissions: android.permission.CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE, android.permission.WRITE_SETTINGS.

Even though we have `android.permission.CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE` in our manifest `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

# Sample output
In the project I included a log statement which outputs the retrieved networkInfo object in the `onAvailable` method. On Android Marshmallow the extra info is the SSID I wanted to connect to `NODE-0066`:

On Android P Beta the extra info is `null`:
